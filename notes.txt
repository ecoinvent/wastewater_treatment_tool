TODO:
    http://84.89.61.64:8030/ecoinvent/simplified_data_entry.php
        Change title (1) from "Wastewater source (activity name)" to "Wastewater source"
        Change help for (1) to:
            "
            If the wastewater originates from an activity within the ecoinvent database, you should use the name of this activity here. 
            For example, for wastewater originating from "lime production", you would write "from lime production".
            This will generate the first part of the name of the wastewater treatment datasets. 
            In the example, it would be "treatment of wastewater from lime production".
            If the wastewater is the average municipal wastewater, then enter the name "average municipal".
            This will generate a name starting with "treatment of wastewater, average municipal"
            The second part of the name will be based on the treatment type.
            "
        Change title (2) from "Country" to "Location"
