CSO COMMENT
In combined sewers, storm events or other episodes that bring large volumes of water can lead to the capacity of the sewers to be exceeded. 
These lead to combined sewer overflow (CSO), during which a portion of the wastewater and its pollutants are discharged without treatment to the environment.
The fraction of wastewater that will on average be emitted due to CSO depends on a number of factors, such as:
- percentage of sewer collection systems that are combined (sanitary + runoff)
- capacity of the sewer systems
- frequency and intensity of events that cause CSO
Ideally, values used to quantify CSO should be region-specific. In our tool, we have #TODO_DEPENDS_ON_DATA_PETER_WILL_SEND.

The model deals with CSO in the following way: 
1) The user enters the wastewater composition that is discharged to the sewer system without any consideration of CSO.
2) The tool looks up the fractions of particulates and dissolved matter that will be lost due to CSO for the country where the water is discharged.
If this information is unavailable, the global average fraction is used.
3) Unless the user entered specific information, the tool will fractionates the inputs (e.g. BOD) into soluble (sBOD) and particulate (pBOD) fractions.
4) The amount of soluble BOD that will be directly sent to the environment can then be calculated directly as 
"loss due to CSO for soluble fraction" * "total amount of BOD" * "sBOD/BOD".
The same apporach is used for all pollutants,not just BOD.
5) This amount of pollutants lost to CSO before reaching the WWTP is then subtracted from the pollutant load entered by the user. The WWTP model therefore treats the wastewater as it entered the WWTP, and not as it was originally discharged. 
6) The amount of pollutants lost to CSO is added to the "direct discharge" dataset that alrady accounted for the fraction of wastewater being sent to sewers not connected to a WWTP.
  
  
TODO:
    http://84.89.61.64:8030/ecoinvent/simplified_data_entry.php
        Change title (2) from "Country" to "Location"
        Add "fraction of C content that is fossil" (and pass back value as fraction_WW_C_fossil)
