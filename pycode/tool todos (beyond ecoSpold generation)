NOTE: these are todos to discuss between Lluis and I.
My list of todos for ecoSpold (uncertainty, comments, etc.) is elsewhere.

**New arguments**
- "untreated_source_regions": The regions from the UNICEF file that the ecoinvent region maps.
    Part of these are in the "region_mapping.xlsx" I sent you on April 4
    The rest, you were able to map directly I think.
    The value I refer to here is found in the Data_clean sheet, column "untreated_source_regions"
    The values should be passed as a dict:
        {ecoinvent_region: untreated_source_region}
    For single WWTP models, there will only be one k:v
    For mixes, there will be many.
- carbon_content, or a procedure for me to estimate this based on inputs
    See email carbon content of WW, fossil vs. non-fossil, COD emissions to air?
- fraction_C_fossil (See email carbon content of WW, fossil vs. non-fossil, COD emissions to air?)


**Data**
- Integrate Peter's data in tool.
- Determine what data to use for GLO
- Fix "untreated" amounts based on new data sent by Pascal

**Tool**
- Force the BOD removal to be selected in the technology description?
- Disactivate ecoSPold generation if BOD removal is not selected.
- Figure out the whole N to environment issue
    see email Re: Missing ecoinvent ids for some items, April 10 7:37
- Figure out what to do with TP emissions to water
    see email Re: Missing ecoinvent ids for some items, April 10 7:37
- Determine where the conversion of amounts of e.g. "NH4 as N" to "NH4" occurs (tool or ecSPold generator)
