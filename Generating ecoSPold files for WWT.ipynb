    "### 1.1) Contents of this Notebook  \n",
    "The WWT LCI tool must generate importable ecoSpold2 tools.  \n",
    "An example ecoSpold already in ecoinvent is found in the repo.  \n",
    "This document shows: \n",
    "  - how to inform all the required fields  \n",
    "  - how to generate the ecoSPold files  \n",
    "Note that **two** ecoSpold files may need to be generated for a given situation: one for WW treatment, and one for WW discharged to the environment without treatment and for particulate content and dissolved substances flushed during hydraulic overload episodes (**See emails on the subject**).  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Some terminology\n",
    "Exchange: input or output of the dataset (product flow, emission, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2) Note on averaging   \n",
    "How averaging (regions, technologies) has been discussed extensively in emails (search for subject \"[ecoinvent WWT project] IMPORTANT: Input from experts required\"  \n",
    "Averaging is **not** considered here - it is expected that it will be done in the tool itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3) Note on uncertainty  \n",
    "The characterization of uncertainty of exchanges in ecoinvent is very important. \n",
    "The uncertainty is by default described by a [lognormal distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-normal_distribution)  \n",
    "The parameters used to define this distribution are based on the underlying normal distribution:  \n",
    "  - $mu = ln(amount)$  \n",
    "  - total variance = variance of underlying normal distribution    \n",
    "\n",
    "The total variance, called $varianceWithPedigreeUncertainty$ in ecoSpold, is a function of: \n",
    "  - the basic uncertainty (simply called $variance$ in ecoSpold), for which we have default values based on the type of exchange we are dealing with, and\n",
    "  - additionnal uncertainty based on a ranking of the quality of the data, the so-called Pedigree matrix approach.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The quality ranking is based on the following table:\n",
    "  ![Pedigree scores](pix\\pedigree_scores.PNG)  \n",
    "The scores are then converted to additional variance using the following factors:  \n",
    "  ![Pedigree scores](pix\\pedigree_scores_to_variance.PNG)  \n",
    "The total uncertainty (called $varianceWithPedigreeUncertainty$ in ecoSpold) is then calculated as the sum of the basic uncertainty and the additional uncertainty, all expressed as variances of the underlying normal.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The difficulty arises when the uncertainty of a given exchange is itself calculated on the basis of uncertain parameters. The uncertainty of the underlying parameters then needs to be **propagated** to the exchange amount. There are different approaches that could be taken here:  \n",
    "  1. Simplest: simply estimate the uncertainty at the exchange level, without formal consideration of the uncertainty of underlying parameters. Lowest quality approach.   \n",
    "  2. Calculate total uncertainty in tool, and and enter the exchange with the total uncertainty. The pedigree scores would be all ones, and the uncertainty comment would say something to the effect of \"uncertainty calculated elsewhere\". This is the approach taken in the old tool.    \n",
    "  3. Enter the parameters as ecoSpold parameters, with uncertainty, and calculate the exchanges as a mathematical relation in ecoSPold. This is the option that is most elegant, but also much more complicated on my end.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Which approach to take is still not determined, but ecoinvent seems to prefer option 2.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I will for now enter dummy uncertainty values with comment \"PLACEHOLDER ESTIMATED UNCERTAINTY\" in places where uncertainty should be estimated (by ICRA, by user) but isn't yet.  \n",
    "I will  for now enter dummy uncertainty values with comment \"PLACEHOLDER CALCULATED UNCERTAINTY\" in places where uncertainty should be _calculated_ but isn't yet.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The uncertainty of parameters are defined as dictionaries with the following structure: `{'variance':0.01, 'pedigreeMatrix':[2,4,3,2,4], 'comment': \"Some comment\"}` "
